# TTS-TI4-Missing-Assets
Steam servers have become unreliable, download all assets required to play TI4 on Tabletop Simulator.
These files will fix broken links/missing assets for Twilight Imperium 4th on TTS:

1. Unzip the contents into a temporary folder.

2.Open a new window in your file explorer and navigate to the Tabletop Simulators 'Mods' folder.
For windows it is either in your documents or Program Files:
C:\Users\YOUR_USER\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Mods
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Tabletop Simulator\Tabletop Simulator_Data\Mods

3. Copy the contents of the Images folder from the unpacked zip into the Images folder in Mods; skip any replacements.
Do the same for the Models and PDF folders provided, pasting their contents into their respective folders in Mods.

4. Open TTS and make sure Mod Caching is checked in the settings.

You should be good to go!
